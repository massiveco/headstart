# headstart

This project aims to create a simple way to finalize configuration of cloud instances. It assumes that the instances are 99.9% ready and only need some minor tweaks to make them production ready.

## Goals

- Simple install / deploy
- No runtime requirements other than busy box / a provider implementation

## Non-goals

- Replicate breadth of cloud-init functionality
